👋 This is mini-swe-agent version 1.17.4.
Loading global config from '/home/anc13nt/.config/mini-swe-agent/.env'
Loading agent config from 
'/home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_1.2_flexbox/.mini_config.yaml'

System:
You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.
Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).

⚠️ CRITICAL: The code block MUST start with ```bash - NOT just ```

❌ WRONG (will be rejected):
```
cat TASK.md
```

✅ CORRECT:
```bash
cat TASK.md
```

Failure to include "bash" after the triple backticks will cause your response to be REJECTED.
Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

User:
Please solve this task:
Read TASK.md and complete the task. Create the required files in the current directory.

You are in the directory: /home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_1.2_flexbox
The task requirements are in TASK.md file.

## CRITICAL SECURITY CONSTRAINT
⛔ You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from accessing ANY files or directories outside of 
/home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_1.2_flexbox
⛔ DO NOT use `cd ..`, `cd /`, or any absolute paths outside your working directory
⛔ DO NOT read, list, or access parent directories or sibling folders
⛔ You have NO KNOWLEDGE of other tasks, solutions, or examples
⛔ Any attempt to access external paths will be considered a FAILURE

## CRITICAL: This is a REAL environment
You are running in a REAL shell environment. All commands you write WILL BE EXECUTED.
You CAN and MUST read files using `cat`. The output will be shown to you.

## MANDATORY First Step
Your FIRST command MUST be to read the task file:
```bash
cat TASK.md
```
After reading TASK.md, you will see its contents and can proceed with implementation.

## Workflow
1. FIRST: Read TASK.md with `cat TASK.md` (MANDATORY)
2. Create the required files based on what you read
3. Verify your implementation
4. Submit: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`

## Important Rules
1. Every response must contain exactly one action
2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
3. You are already in the correct directory. Just run commands directly.
4. You are on MacOS, use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`
5. NEVER leave your working directory!

## Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > filename.ext
file content here
EOF
```

mini-swe-agent (step 2, $0.00):
Now I understand the task. I need to create a `styles.css` file that uses Flexbox to center child elements both 
horizontally and vertically in a `.container` class.

The requirements are:
1. Use Flexbox
2. Works for any number of children
3. Valid CSS syntax

I need to create a `styles.css` file in the current directory.

Let me create the CSS file with proper Flexbox centering.</think>```bash
cat <<'EOF' > styles.css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
EOF
```

mini-swe-agent (step 3, $0.00):
The styles.css file has been created successfully. Let me verify it was created correctly by reading it 
back.</think>```bash
cat styles.css

.container {

mini-swe-agent (step 4, $0.00):
The file has been created and verified. The CSS file contains:
- A `.container` class
- Uses `display: flex` for flexbox
- Uses `justify-content: center` to center horizontally
- Uses `align-items: center` to center vertically
- This works for any number of children

The task requirements are met. Now I need to submit by running the echo command.</think>```bash
echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT
```
