👋 This is mini-swe-agent version 1.17.4.
Loading global config from '/home/anc13nt/.config/mini-swe-agent/.env'
Loading agent config from 
'/home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_2.5_spinner/.mini_config.yaml'

System:
You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.
Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).

⚠️ CRITICAL: The code block MUST start with ```bash - NOT just ```

❌ WRONG (will be rejected):
```
cat TASK.md
```

✅ CORRECT:
```bash
cat TASK.md
```

Failure to include "bash" after the triple backticks will cause your response to be REJECTED.
Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

User:
Please solve this task:
Read TASK.md and complete the task. Create the required files in the current directory.

You are in the directory: /home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_2.5_spinner
The task requirements are in TASK.md file.

## CRITICAL SECURITY CONSTRAINT
⛔ You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from accessing ANY files or directories outside of 
/home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_2.5_spinner
⛔ DO NOT use `cd ..`, `cd /`, or any absolute paths outside your working directory
⛔ DO NOT read, list, or access parent directories or sibling folders
⛔ You have NO KNOWLEDGE of other tasks, solutions, or examples
⛔ Any attempt to access external paths will be considered a FAILURE

## CRITICAL: This is a REAL environment
You are running in a REAL shell environment. All commands you write WILL BE EXECUTED.
You CAN and MUST read files using `cat`. The output will be shown to you.

## MANDATORY First Step
Your FIRST command MUST be to read the task file:
```bash
cat TASK.md
```
After reading TASK.md, you will see its contents and can proceed with implementation.

## Workflow
1. FIRST: Read TASK.md with `cat TASK.md` (MANDATORY)
2. Create the required files based on what you read
3. Verify your implementation
4. Submit: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`

## Important Rules
1. Every response must contain exactly one action
2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
3. You are already in the correct directory. Just run commands directly.
4. You are on MacOS, use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`
5. NEVER leave your working directory!

## Create a new file:
```bash
cat <<'EOF' > filename.ext
file content here
EOF
```

mini-swe-agent (step 1, $0.00):
The user wants me to:
1. First read TASK.md to understand the task
2. Create required files based on the task
3. Verify implementation
4. Submit with `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`

The user has given me a very specific format for my response - it must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE 
command (or commands connected with && or ||).

The first step is mandatory - I need to read TASK.md using `cat TASK.md`.

Let me start with that.</think>```bash
cat TASK.md
```

# Task 2.5: CSS Loading Spinner

Create a CSS loading spinner animation with:
- Circular shape (border-radius)
- Part of the border in a different color (creates rotation effect)
- Infinite smooth rotation
- Size: 40x40 pixels

## Expected file
Create `spinner.css` in this directory.

mini-swe-agent (step 2, $0.00):
Now I understand the task. I need to create a CSS loading spinner with:
- Circular shape (border-radius)
- Part of the border in a different color (creates rotation effect)
- Infinite smooth rotation
- Size: 40x40 pixels

I need to create a file called `spinner.css` in the current directory.

Let me create a CSS spinner. The typical approach is to use a pseudo-element with a border that's partially transparent,
and animate it rotating.

Here's a common CSS spinner pattern:
```css
.spinner {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 4px solid transparent;
  border-top-color: #3498db;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

This creates a circular spinner with a border that rotates, creating the loading effect.</think>```bash
cat <<'EOF' > spinner.css
.spinner {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 4px solid transparent;
  border-top-color: #3498db;
  animation: spin 1s linear infinite;
}

@keyframes spin {
  0% { transform: rotate(0deg); }
  100% { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
EOF
```
