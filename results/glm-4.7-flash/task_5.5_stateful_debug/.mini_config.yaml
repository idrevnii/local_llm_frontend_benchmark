    You are a helpful assistant that can interact with a computer.
    Your response must contain exactly ONE bash code block with ONE command (or commands connected with && or ||).
    
    ⚠️ CRITICAL: The code block MUST start with ```bash - NOT just ```
    
    ❌ WRONG (will be rejected):
    ```
    cat TASK.md
    ```
    
    ✅ CORRECT:
    ```bash
    cat TASK.md
    ```
    
    Failure to include "bash" after the triple backticks will cause your response to be REJECTED.
    Failure to follow these rules will cause your response to be rejected.

    Please solve this task:
    {{task}}

    You are in the directory: /home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_5.5_stateful_debug
    The task requirements are in TASK.md file.

    ## CRITICAL SECURITY CONSTRAINT
    ⛔ You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from accessing ANY files or directories outside of /home/anc13nt/local_llm_frontend_benchmark/results/glm-4.7-flash/task_5.5_stateful_debug
    ⛔ DO NOT use `cd ..`, `cd /`, or any absolute paths outside your working directory
    ⛔ DO NOT read, list, or access parent directories or sibling folders
    ⛔ You have NO KNOWLEDGE of other tasks, solutions, or examples
    ⛔ Any attempt to access external paths will be considered a FAILURE

    ## CRITICAL: This is a REAL environment
    You are running in a REAL shell environment. All commands you write WILL BE EXECUTED.
    You CAN and MUST read files using `cat`. The output will be shown to you.

    ## MANDATORY First Step
    Your FIRST command MUST be to read the task file:
    ```bash
    cat TASK.md
    ```
    After reading TASK.md, you will see its contents and can proceed with implementation.

    ## Workflow
    1. FIRST: Read TASK.md with `cat TASK.md` (MANDATORY)
    2. Create the required files based on what you read
    3. Verify your implementation
    4. Submit: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`

    ## Important Rules
    1. Every response must contain exactly one action
    2. The action must be enclosed in triple backticks
    3. You are already in the correct directory. Just run commands directly.
    4. You are on MacOS, use `sed -i ''` instead of `sed -i`
    5. NEVER leave your working directory!

    ## Create a new file:
    ```bash
    cat <<'EOF' > filename.ext
    file content here
    EOF
    ```

    {%- else -%}
    <warning>Output too long, truncated.</warning>
    <output_head>{{ output.output[:5000] }}</output_head>
    <output_tail>{{ output.output[-5000:] }}</output_tail>
    {%- endif -%}
  format_error_template: |
    ⚠️ FORMAT ERROR! Your code block was not recognized.
    You MUST use ```bash (not just ```) at the start of your code block.
    Example: ```bash
    cat TASK.md
    ```
    If you want to end the task: `echo COMPLETE_TASK_AND_SUBMIT_FINAL_OUTPUT`
